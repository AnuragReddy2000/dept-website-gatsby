Students do introductory mathematics, physics, chemistry, life sciences, and bio-engineering courses in the first stage. The program also begins with courses on programming and skill development such as English communication, introduction to entrepreneurship, artificial intelligence, and creative arts electives.",
                "The second stage is a phase of nurturing students to make them multiskilled for both industry or academics. During the 3rd to 5th semester, the program covers the core foundational courses from pure mathematics, applied mathematics, statistics, and computing courses from computer science, artificial intelligence, and electrical engineering. The blend of carefully selected theoretical, applicable, and computing courses will enable students to choose the career they wish to pursue.",
                "The third stage is all about exploration. The dream career that students have decided to pursue by the end of the second stage begins from the 6th semester. The exploration nature comes from the fact that 38 credits out of 46 credits from the 6th to 8th semester come in electives. Namely, half of the credits are of advanced mathematics and computational mathematics electives. Students have 12 credits of free elective courses to choose from any department in the institute. The students have an option of a semester-long Industry project in the 6th semester. Department also offers credited research projects for two semesters in this stage up to 6 credits.",
                "Upon successfully completing the Mathematics and computing program, students will be able to pursue the dream of becoming industry professionals. This program also provides an opportunity for higher education in mathematics, computer science, artificial intelligence, etc., in world-class universities.",
