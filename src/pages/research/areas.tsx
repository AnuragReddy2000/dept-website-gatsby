                <TableView title='Fluid Dynamics:' content={'The study of hydrodynamic stability is an important aspect of the fluid mechanics, largely due to the fact that an unstable flow is not observable and which, in practice, is broken down by “small variations” in flow. It is the task of the stability analyst to identify the critical parameters causing the instability in the flow field. There are two different approaches to address this problem - the first is the linear stability analysis and the second is the non-linear stability analysis.\n\nThe linear stability analysis gives a sufficient condition under which the flow is unstable and talks nothing about the stability of the flow field. On the other hand, the nonlinear stability approach (via energy functional) gives a condition under which the flow field is stable but fails to address the instability of the system. In this way these two theories complement each other and resulting into the sub-critical instabilities. Our efforts are to address this phenomenon for a variety of problems both in clear fluids and flows through porous media.'}/>

Various kinds of spectrum of an elements in a Banach algebra with applications towards numerical solutions of operator equations, studying images of certain function spaces under transforms like Segal-Bargmann transforms, construction of frames in Fock spaces.'}/>

These two areas have become increasingly important from the viewpoint of academicians, as well as, practitioners. The members of the group primarily focus:  (i) stochastically comparing the performance or the reliability of the systems by making certain assumptions on the components, and  (ii) designing the cost effective experiments related to the linear and generalized linear models with correlated responses."}/>
                <TableView title='Theory of Non-linear PDEs:' content={'Our focus is in particular on semilinear and quasilinear PDEs of elliptic type. Variational methods and geometric analysis are two important tools which are widely used in studying the existence and qualitative behaviour of different kind of solutions of these particular type of PDEs. Recently a lot of interest has grown in the area of non-local operators which appear in many different contexts like thin obstacle problem, optimization, finance, phase transitions, conservation laws, multiple scattering, minimal surfaces, material science etc. A natural question arises here is whether the classical variational and geometric methods can be used to handle these type of non-local nonlinear problems. The current focus is on these type of questions and developing the theory for general non-local operators.'}/>
